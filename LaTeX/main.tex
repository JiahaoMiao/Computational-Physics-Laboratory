    \begin{abstract}
    This report explores the use of the Mathematica software package to compute tree-level gluon scattering amplitudes in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD),
    leveraging its powerful algebraic capabilities.
    The main focus is on utilizing Mathematica's list manipulation functions to represent Feynman diagrams, applying Feynman rules to evaluate the corresponding scattering amplitudes. 
    Emphasis is placed on the computational techniques used to automate and simplify these calculations, including the verification of key properties such as Ward identities and 
    symmetry under the exchange of external legs. 
    The report highlights the efficiency of Mathematica in handling complex algebraic expressions and streamlining the process of evaluating quantum field theory amplitudes.
