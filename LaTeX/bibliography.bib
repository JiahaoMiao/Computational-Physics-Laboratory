abstract = {We find that, for QED and for SU(N) gauge theories, single hard bremsstrahlung cross sections are remarkably simple in the ultrarelativistic limit. They can be written as a product of two factors: one factor is connected with the lowest order, elastic process, and the second one is related to the infrared factor which describes soft quantum emission. We present explicit formulae for various processes.}

author = {Vittorio {Del Duca} and Lance Dixon and Fabio Maltoni},
keywords = {Color decompositions, Perturbative QCD},
abstract = {Recently, a color decomposition using structure constants was introduced for purely gluonic tree amplitudes, in a compact form involving only the linearly independent subamplitudes. We give two proofs that this decomposition holds for an arbitrary number of gluons. We also present and prove similar decompositions at one loop, both for pure gluon amplitudes and for amplitudes with an external quarkâ€“antiquark pair.}
